))}

{user ? (
  // Display "View Notes" button
) : (

)}
```
- If a user is logged in, a "View Notes" button is displayed, allowing access to personalized notes.

### Return Values
- The `Index` component returns a fully rendered JSX structure that includes a title, videos, and navigation options.

## Potential Side Effects
- The component relies on the user state from `useOptionalUser`, which may alter the rendered output based on login status.
- External resources, such as images and videos, are fetched from URLs, which may lead to loading delays if resources are unavailable.

## Conclusion
This component serves as a dynamic and visually appealing landing page that showcases examples of personalized songs by chYOUz. It utilizes conditional rendering to provide tailored navigation options based on user authentication status, thus enhancing user experience. Future developers should ensure that external resources are kept up to date and maintain accessibility standards across the component.
